                        Survivors
                        and heal both herself and her team more effectively. She uses her time out of the fog to collect
                        potent plants found around the Campfire to create tinctures that can stop bleeding.

                        alt="quote sign resembling Entity's claws">From the day that her parents gave Claudette her
                    first science kit, she loved experiments. Her single-minded pursuit lead to an early scholarship at
                    a great college. It was a huge decision to leave Montreal, but the chance was too good to pass up.
                    Her introverted nature means that chat rooms and forums are now her best source of social
                    interaction. Her new favourite activity is to answer botany questions for others under her new
                    moniker of Science Girl. One evening, during a long bus ride back from the city, Claudette took a
                    stroll that would change her life. It only took a minute for her to get completely disoriented in
                    the thick woods. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week
                    after she stopped posting.
                    <br>
                    Claudette is not the outgoing type. Her brilliance provided her with a social handicap and she has
                    fled the real world for chat rooms and forums. Botany and studies fill her life and even though she
                    yearns for something else - it wonâ€™t come via a modem. Being thrown into a real-life situation can
                    feel awkward and forced. But as she is used to shutting out the world, she suddenly finds hope in
                    this inexplicable darkness that is slowly devouring her. A plant. A tree. A bush. Simple greenery
                    that might save a life. She hides within and amongst them. Her knowledge and skills flourish as
                    gruesomeness roams free around her.
