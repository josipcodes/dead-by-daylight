                                Claudette her
                                first science kit, she loved experiments. Her single-minded pursuit lead to an early
                                scholarship at
                                a great college. It was a huge decision to leave Montreal, but the chance was too good
                                to pass up.
                                Her introverted nature means that chat rooms and forums are now her best source of
                                social
                                interaction. Her new favourite activity is to answer botany questions for others under
                                her new
                                moniker of Science Girl. One evening, during a long bus ride back from the city,
                                Claudette took a
                                stroll that would change her life. It only took a minute for her to get completely
                                disoriented in
                                the thick woods. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where
                                she was a week
                                after she stopped posting.

                                Claudette is not the outgoing type. Her brilliance provided her with a social handicap
                                and she has
                                fled the real world for chat rooms and forums. Botany and studies fill her life and even
                                though she
                                yearns for something else - it wonâ€™t come via a modem. Being thrown into a real-life
                                situation can
                                feel awkward and forced. But as she is used to shutting out the world, she suddenly
                                finds hope in
                                this inexplicable darkness that is slowly devouring her. A plant. A tree. A bush. Simple
                                greenery
                                that might save a life. She hides within and amongst them. Her knowledge and skills
                                flourish as
                                gruesomeness roams free around her.

                                school. He always wanted to be one of the cool kids, but somehow never had the charisma.
                                He tried out for the football team but was cut, the basketball team didn't even take a
                                look, and his grades were distinctly below average. One weekend, on a team-building
                                exercise from his dead-end job, Dwight's boss led them deep into the woods before
                                breaking out his family recipe moonshine. Dwight remembered taking the first sip before
                                waking up late the next morning all alone. During the night, the others had abandoned
                                him. Once again, the laughing stock of the community Dwight tried to hike his way out of
                                the woods. That was the last anyone ever heard of Dwight Fairfield.
                                <br>
                                Dwight isn't the typical guy you think of when someone says "Survivor". He lacks that
                                certain pizzazz and without his glasses, he's more or less blind. But as the sun sets
                                and the woods come alive, Dwight clasps to his rat race life, making sure that he'll
                                live to see another day even though something unimaginable is after him. Dwight won't
                                stop. He'll survive no matter what. As others spent hours being seen in high school. He
                                spent hours becoming invisible and avoiding danger. And it doesn't matter if it's
                                dangers in the hallway or dangers in the woods. Survival is key. As other employees
                                panic when terror infects them, Dwight makes use of his disturbing teen experience. The
                                tables have now turned and now others need to follow to Dwight's firm directions if they
                                are to survive as he knows how to disappear.

                                    alt="quote sign resembling Entity's claws">One of Kate Denson's earliest memories
                                was standing in front of her family, singing a song that she'd learned that morning at
                                school, and watching smiles spread across their faces. Seeing how something as simple as
                                a song could make people so happy was the moment when she knew what she wanted to do
                                with her life.
                                <br>
                                She practised, learned the guitar as soon as she was big enough to reach over it, and
                                was performing in front of crowds by the time she was eight years old. Her mother did
                                everything she could to fulfil Kate's dreams, taking her all over their home state of
                                Pennsylvania, then across the South, and even to Nashville itself.
                                <br>
                                Kate won folk music competitions and talent shows whenever she participated, but for her
                                to win others had to lose, and that wasn't in her nature. She only wanted an outlet, a
                                way to touch people's lives. To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy
                                themselves, if only for a while.
                                <br>
                                With age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to
                                travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped. Hers
                                wasn't a story of rock excess though: just the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon
                                to end the day.
                                <br>
                                From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy bars, people flocked to her voice and her
                                self-penned songs of friendship, family, love and home.
                                <br>
                                These sentiments weren't just lip-service: she made sure to return home as often as she
                                could, to help out in her community and entertain the local children with her tales of
                                the wider world. She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same
                                way she had been.
                                <br>
                                It was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to
                                take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a
                                quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favourite location she returned to
                                time and time again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it
                                had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.
                                <br>
                                Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind
                                be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.
                                <br>
                                She picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music
                                that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more
                                melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.
                                <br>
                                Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the
                                trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the
                                canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, she grabbed a rock and tried to
                                beat them back, but their skin was hard as iron and the rock simply bounced off and
                                skittered away.
                                <br>
                                The legs coiled like tendrils around her limbs and lifted her towards the darkness
                                overhead. Fog rolled across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of
                                nightmares that drew her up towards itself.
                                <br>
                                When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just an acoustic
                                guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in
                                mother of pearl.

                                Carmina Mora was a gifted artist who carried the guilt of her young brother's death.
                                Growing up a rugged coastal village in southern Chile, she sketched the sublime
                                landscapes of Patagonia. Sitting outside, she painted dramatic fjords while feeding the
                                crows nested in the tree next to the house.
                                <br>
                                She grew up carrying the guilt of her mother's sudden departure. Her father blamed
                                Carmina for her mother's abandonment, which added to her grief. She became the caretaker
                                of Matias, her little brother, despite still being a child herself.
                                <br>
                                A year later, Carmina was painting with Matias outside when the telephone rang. Her
                                father remained in the yard, drinking his beer. Carmina rushed to the house to answer
                                the phone and hung up a few seconds later. When she returned outside, Matias was nowhere
                                to be seen. She asked her father, but he had paid no attention to Matias. She called her
                                brother's name, looking for him everywhere. While searching, she saw a bright red coat
                                floating on the narrow creek by the house â€” Matias' jacket. She jumped into the creek
                                and found him floating on the surface with vacant eyes, unblinking. He had fallen and
                                drowned.
                                <br>
                                Her scream tore the sky. Her father found Carmina sobbing on the creek's shore,
                                clutching her brother's body in her arms, surrounded by a murder of crows. Her father
                                snatched Matias's body away from her, and she cried until her voice broke.
                                <br>
                                The following morning, the world was cloaked in darkness. Her father did not say a word,
                                because he did not have to. Carmina knew it was all her fault. Months passed, yet her
                                loss was as fresh as morning dew. Crippled with self-loathing, she could no longer
                                paint. Without Matias, life had no meaning.
                                <br>
                                On the bleak morning of Matias' birthday, Carmina walked to a narrow bridge several
                                blocks away from home. She was convinced that nothing could bring her relief. Her mother
                                was gone, her brother was dead, and her father blamed her for it all. She was convinced
                                that she had nothing left to live for.
                                <br>
                                Carmina walked to the railing of the bridge that stood over the turbulent river. Locals
                                had nicknamed the spot DeathLeap. Several cars drove by Carmina, but none stopped. No
                                one seemed to care. She climbed over the railing and her legs wobbled as she stood on
                                the lip of the bridge. She looked down, watching the fierce river smash into a giant
                                boulder. She closed her eyes.
                                <br>
                                "See you soon, Matias."
                                <br>
                                Suddenly, a cacophony of caws filled the sky. Carmina opened her eyes and saw a black
                                cloud of feathers flying towards her. The cloud split open and glossy black crows dove
                                from the sky. One landed on her shoulder and stared intently into Carmina's eyes, as if
                                peering into her soul. Her grip on the railing loosened and the crow cawed raucously.
                                Carmina stared at the crow, confused.
                                <br>
                                Another crow landed on the railing, then another. Soon, a flock of crows were covering
                                the railing of the bridge, staying close to her. She felt their heavy stare on her,
                                calculative and enigmatic, as if they were assessing her. She looked down for a second
                                and a thunder of caws interrupted her dark impulse. The crows seemed to care about her
                                wellbeing. As she dangled over the edge with the wind blowing through her raven hair,
                                Carmina felt akin to them. For the first time since Matias had died, Carmina did not
                                feel alone.
                                <br>
                                She returned home, giving life another chance. The crows left, but Carmina suspected
                                that if anything happened to her, they would return.
                                <br>
                                Inspired by her ordeal, Carmina picked up a brush. In the weeks that followed, she
                                painted her experience, using black ink to depict the DeathLeap with a black cloud of
                                feathers, the murder of crows that saved her life. The experience was transformative and
                                launched her signature, black-ink surrealist art.
                                <br>
                                After several years, some colour pierced the darkness, and this shift of medium expanded
                                her art form. She painted large-scale murals on busy street corners, designed grandiose
                                costumes, and recited militant poetry. Carmina's art displayed local, intimate tragedies
                                on a large scale, making them impossible to ignore. And everywhere she performed, crows
                                followed.
                                <br>
                                Her performances grew bold and drew the attention of artists who found her style
                                invigorating. She grew close to a group of painters who understood her iconoclastic
                                vision. Her performances launched the Large-Scale Surrealist movement, which became a
                                phenomenon.
                                <br>
                                Her renown grew enough to attract the commission of a multinational enterprise, The Vack
                                Label. Carmina investigated the group, discovering that they gifted art pieces to select
                                disreputable congressmen. Vack's commissioned artists seemed to disappear afterward.
                                <br>
                                Determined to expose the group's link to corrupt politics, Carmina accepted Vack's
                                commission. The following week, Carmina painted a giant mural on a cemetery's
                                columbarium, displaying the Vack Label logo as a surrealist grim reaper harvesting the
                                fields of Chilean families. She wore a theatrical dress as she painted, on which she had
                                stitched a poem about political revolution.
                                <br>
                                The piece sparked a radical debate about corruption. The controversy painted a target on
                                Carmina's back. After receiving anonymous death threats, she took refuge in her father's
                                house, bringing along her closest friends for safety.
                                <br>
                                That night, a gang of masked gunmen broke into the house. They swiftly subdued Carmina
                                and her friends, threw them in a van, and drove off.
                                <br>
                                The following morning, a dry breeze blew sand on Carmina's face, awakening her. She was
                                seated in a chair in the middle of the desert, with her legs tied and her hands
                                handcuffed. Her friends were lying on the ground, tied up. A shadow fell over her face.
                                Carmina looked up.
                                <br>
                                A man dressed in a long robe with his face hidden in a dark hood approached her. He
                                pulled a silvery knife from his robe.

                                He grabbed her hands and recited a hymn in an unfamiliar language. Carmina held his
                                gaze. He paused and brought down his blade with a sudden blow.
                                <br>
                                She cried in agony as her friends woke to a terrible sight; Carmina's severed hands
                                falling in the sand.
                                <br>
                                The hooded man smiled in satisfaction. "How are you going to paint now?" Carmina cursed
                                and screamed at him, wriggling against the bonds on her legs.
                                <br>
                                The man grabbed Carmina's chin. She spit in his face.
                                <br>
                                He grunted and pried her mouth open, pulling out her tongue. Carmina struggled in his
                                hold. In a violent blow, he chopped off Carmina's tongue.
                                <br>
                                She howled in anguish. The man wiped his blade on his robe, leaving a trail of blood.
                                "How are you going to recite poems now?"
                                <br>
                                Sorrow swelled in Carmina's chest, sharper than pain. Overwhelmed by uncontrollable
                                rage, grief and loss overcame her senses. She had lost her little brother. And she had
                                lost the only way to cope with such pain. Carmina screamed like on the day her brother
                                died.
                                <br>
                                Raucous caws echoed through the wasteland. The sky was obscured by a cyclone of dark
                                clouds. Black feathers fell on Carmina's bleeding arms. She looked up and saw a torrent
                                of crows erupting from the clouds, diving on the hooded man.
                                <br>
                                As the ravenous crows pecked at his flesh mercilessly, Carmina smiled, watching her
                                Surrealist art coming to life.
                                <br>
                                But her heart lurched with rage when she saw the crows move on to their next target, her
                                friends on the ground. She screamed as waves of pain, guilt, and fright overwhelmed her.
                                But it was in vain, the ravenous crows were uncontrollable.
                                <br>
                                Darkness fell over her eyes as her friends' agonising screams grew more acute. Death was
                                coming and again, it was her fault.
                                <br>
                                A deep, Black Fog engulfed her.

                        Sally Smithson came to town with dreams of children's feet and laughter in a wooden home built
                        by her husband Andrew. But life came not with smiles but with plans of destruction. Andrew
                        worked as a lumberjack - a job with its perils. One day, Andrew's foreman had to pay Sally a
                        visit, forever changing her life. She was alone.
                        <br>
                        Without food on the table and no other option, Sally had to find a way, but the only employment
                        she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. Nobody sought employment there unless they were in
                        dire need. Just like Sally. Without any education, she started at the bottom, doing the hard
                        night shift.
                        <br>
                        Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, two decades of seeing horrid things that
                        violate the eyes. Memories that are re-played every night. Being abused verbally and physically,
                        by people without limits. Sally saw insanity from the outside, just to catch it herself.
                        <br>
                        Finally she could not take it any more and concepts of purification emerged inside her. She did
                        what she felt was necessary. As the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over
                        fifty dead patients, lifeless, in their bed along four staff members, also dead.
                        <br>
                        Only Sally had survived the night, but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop.
                        Exactly what happened is only known by her, but it seems that some of them had been choked as
                        they had marks around their necks. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never
                        reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally
                        nowhere to be found.

                        Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything than hope for a new beginning. He was happy
                        as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a
                        blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took place.
                        <br>
                        Ojomo didn't care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland and as long as he
                        didn't get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he
                        did really well. A car went in and a small, metallic cube came out.
                        <br>
                        It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the
                        un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands with
                        panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo's boss stopped
                        him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained to him that he'd been
                        nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them as this was
                        a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients".
                        <br>
                        Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress,
                        as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left
                        and was never seen again.
