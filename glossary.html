                                    alt="quote sign resembling Entity's claws">From the day that her parents gave Claudette her
                                first science kit, she loved experiments. Her single-minded pursuit lead to an early scholarship at
                                a great college. It was a huge decision to leave Montreal, but the chance was too good to pass up.
                                Her introverted nature means that chat rooms and forums are now her best source of social
                                interaction. Her new favourite activity is to answer botany questions for others under her new
                                moniker of Science Girl. One evening, during a long bus ride back from the city, Claudette took a
                                stroll that would change her life. It only took a minute for her to get completely disoriented in
                                the thick woods. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week
                                after she stopped posting.
                                <br>
                                Claudette is not the outgoing type. Her brilliance provided her with a social handicap and she has
                                fled the real world for chat rooms and forums. Botany and studies fill her life and even though she
                                yearns for something else - it wonâ€™t come via a modem. Being thrown into a real-life situation can
                                feel awkward and forced. But as she is used to shutting out the world, she suddenly finds hope in
                                this inexplicable darkness that is slowly devouring her. A plant. A tree. A bush. Simple greenery
                                that might save a life. She hides within and amongst them. Her knowledge and skills flourish as
                                gruesomeness roams free around her.
